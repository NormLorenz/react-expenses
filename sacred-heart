Hi Brenda,

First I would like to say how incredible it is be here in ED and how honored
I am to work together with the many dedicated and professional people. I appreciate
the time people take to explain various duties and the simple thank you on a job well done.

Over the past several months I think I understand my responsibilities and the
different roles between ED Escorts an ED Volunteers however I know that sometimes we cross
each other domains and pitch in to get the job done.

There have been instances where I've been asked to shepherd patients to their rooms. 
This may be simply a training issue between volunteers and the staff. With
long waiting times in the lobby, the nurse is under pressure not only to triage patients 
but move those to available rooms in the back.

All in all, I'm amazed how well it all works.

Norm
